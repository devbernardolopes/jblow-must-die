# AGENTS.md

This is a Godot 4.7.2 project for a 2D top-down shooter game.
The underlying world rules follow D&D 5.5e (abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma).
This game is currently being developed and it is in very early stages. No one is playing it other than the solo human developer.

## Requirements

- Godot 4.7.2.
- GDScript.
- Statically typed (every function signature fully annotated; no untyped vars in new code; typed arrays and typed lambdas/Callables where practical).
- Fluid layout for all UI, must look good in desktop, mobile, and web.
- Keyboard and game controller support.
- Use snake case and screaming snake case for constants.
- All assets (images, musics, fonts, textures, and so on) will be provided by the human developer. Never fetch or generate binary assets. Code must work with missing art (fall back to flat colors / placeholder shapes).
- User-facing strings are plain English literals for now. Do not add i18n infrastructure.
- No secrets in the repo (no committed keys, tokens, or credentials).
- No commented-out dead code (git keeps history).
- Don't choose names for local variables that will shadow anything else (properties, methods, etc). Prefix with underscore if needed.

## Testing

All **gameplay** testing is manual by the human after every iteration: do not run the main game scene.
The testing devices is:

1. Samsung Odyssey laptop running Omarchy Quattro in 1920 x 1080 @ 60 Hz.

Agents must validate scripts without running gameplay. Use the headless harness.
Never ship a script with parse or compile errors.

## Agent Workflow Notes (learned the hard way — keep current)

- While the agent writes files, keep those files **closed** in the Godot script editor: an open buffer can silently revert external writes on focus/undo/save.
- After every script write, **read the file back from disk** — never trust the write receipt alone.
- `node_set_property` cannot coerce strings to bool/int — set non-string properties in GDScript instead.
- `input_map` calls must be **sequential** (parallel bursts wedge the backend lock); `project_manage settings_set` accepts invalid keys without complaint (verify setting names against engine docs).
- Godot 4 API differs from Godot 3 memory (e.g. `ScrollContainer.horizontal_scroll_mode`). When unsure about a property or method, check the Godot 4.7 docs instead of guessing.
- Editor-log ghosts: the log buffer re-emits stale diagnostics on scans — confirm errors against current file contents (grep) before treating them as live.
- Never reference `EditorInterface` directly from a script that is shipped in a game: editor classes are stripped from export templates and the script then fails to load. Access it only under `Engine.is_editor_hint()` through `Engine.get_singleton(&"EditorInterface")`.
- Godot generates `.gd.uid` sidecars; keep them tracked so scenes and references stay stable.

## Commit Convention

When there are changes to commit, AI agents should suggest an one-line commit message at the end of their response following conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`. Use types like `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore` and keep descriptions concise but descriptive — focus on the "why" rather than the "what". This message must be in own line to facilitate copying.
